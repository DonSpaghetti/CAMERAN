Discord Bot 2: Electric Boogaloo

CAMERAN is a Discord Bot we are making for our group chat, mostly to practice Python and learn new things.

As our understanding of programming grows, we will attempt to integrate successively more complex ideas. 

Eventually, we'd like CAMERAN to provide not only useful information (such as the weather and how to make a margarita),
but also be able to respond as an uncanny chatbot with multiple personalities (One for each name represented in the acronym).

This direction will likely provide an opportunity for us to learn more about things like Natural Language Processing
and Tensorflow.
